While the agent will not provide clinical diagnoses or therapy, it will be equipped to recognize severe distress signals and suggest resources for professional help. The expected outcome is a working prototype that effectively demonstrates how conversational AI can serve as a proactive tool in the mental health domain, offering a crucial first step for individuals who may be hesitant to approach traditional care channels. </li>
    <li><img src="./assets/img2.jpg" width="30px",height="20px" >The prevalence of mental health conditions is increasing worldwide, creating an urgent need for accessible and immediate support systems. This project proposes the design and development of an "AI-Based Conversational Agent for Early Detection of Mental Health Issues." The core objective is to create an intelligent chatbot that can engage users in text-based conversations, analyze their emotional state through sentiment analysis, and identify potential early-stage signs of mental distress. The system will be architected with a user-friendly web interface and a robust backend powered by NLP models. It will offer anonymity and 24/7 availability, removing common barriers to seeking help.</li>

The digital revolution presents a unique opportunity to address these challenges through technology. wh</li>
